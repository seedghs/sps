title:Pieta
author:Jasmine Willis
content:We think the forest
    From which we rose
    Is not a part of us
    Until we join it again.
    We forget
    Few are our wants
    Because the Earth that birthed us
    Nurtures us in its bosom.
    We cannot see our Mother
    Because she is not like us.
    Her hands are tough, gnarled trees.
    Her milk is cool spring water.
    The chest upon which we sleep
    Is soft, spongy soil.
    And she throws upon us a blanket
    Knitted from the leaves of her hair.
    She has seen her better days
    Way back in Paradise,
    When we knew from whence we came
    And how.
    Now her bosom is empty.
    We have stolen her ribs
    To birth ourselves,
    And we build our homes
    Atop her cavernous carcass.
    The lullaby
    Of her screams
    Lull us to sleep
    And we wake
    Each morning
    To her moans
    Of sorrow.
    Mother Mourned over the body of Son
    We
    Thrive within the corpse of
    Mother.
